# Projects Index

> **Work in Progress:** This section will link to public GitHub repositories demonstrating production AI systems. Each project will be fully documented and deployable.

## 🚧 Active Development

I'm currently building public projects that demonstrate end-to-end MLOps and AI platform engineering. Each project will include:

- **Full source code** on GitHub
- **Architecture documentation** with Mermaid diagrams
- **Deployment instructions** with Terraform/Helm
- **CI/CD pipelines** ready to run
- **Comprehensive README** with setup guides

## Planned Projects

| Project | Description | Status | GitHub |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Production RAG System** | End-to-end RAG with evaluation framework, hybrid search, cost optimization | 🚧 In Progress | TBD |
| **MLOps Platform Starter** | Kubernetes-native platform with MLflow, model registry, CI/CD | 📋 Planned | TBD |
| **RAG Evaluation Framework** | Automated quality assessment with custom metrics | 📋 Planned | TBD |
| **Agentic Workflow Engine** | LangGraph-based multi-agent orchestration | 📋 Planned | TBD |
| **Intelligent CV Generator** | AI-powered resume builder (this repo's generator) | 📋 To be open-sourced | TBD |

## Why Public Projects?

While I have extensive consulting experience (banking, energy, cybersecurity), most of that work is confidential. I'm building public demonstrations to show:

1. **Production-quality code** - Not toy examples, but systems designed for scale
2. **End-to-end ownership** - From architecture to deployment to monitoring
3. **Real trade-offs** - Documented decisions with ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
4. **Operational thinking** - CI/CD, observability, security, cost optimization

## Coming Soon: First Case Study

I'm starting with a **Production RAG System** that will demonstrate:

- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- LLM integration with Azure OpenAI
- Custom evaluation framework
- Cost optimization strategies
- Kubernetes deployment
- Full CI/CD pipeline

**Target:** End-to-end documentation from requirements to production deployment.
