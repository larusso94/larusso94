## Roles I'm Looking For

### **Primary Target: Senior/Staff MLOps Engineer**
**What I want to do:**
- Build production MLOps platforms (experiment tracking, model registry, CI/CD, monitoring)
- Design and deploy RAG systems and agentic AI workflows
- Own infrastructure-as-code (Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm)
- Lead technical initiatives and mentor junior engineers

**Ideal environment:**
- Scale-up or growth-stage company (50-500 people)
- Strong engineering culture (code reviews, testing, documentation)
- Production-first mindset (shipping matters more than perfection)
- Azure or GCP cloud environment

---

### **Secondary Target: AI Platform Engineer**
**What I want to do:**
- Build internal AI platforms for product/engineering teams
- Enable self-service AI capabilities (agent deployment, RAG APIs, model serving)
- Design governance frameworks (cost control, observability, compliance)
- Work cross-functionally with product, data science, and engineering

**Ideal environment:**
- Company with multiple AI use cases (not just one product)
- Need for centralized platform (reduce duplication, increase quality)
- Technical complexity (multi-tenancy, scale, cost optimization)

---

### **Long-Term Interest: Technical Lead / Engineering Manager**
**What I want to grow into:**
- Lead a team of MLOps/Platform engineers (3-8 people)
- Own technical roadmap for AI infrastructure
- Influence company strategy on AI platforms and tooling
- Balance hands-on coding (50%) with leadership (50%)

**Timeline:** 1-2 years from now, but open to opportunities that offer clear path

## What I'm Looking For in a Company

### **Must-Haves:**
✅ **Production AI systems** – Real users, real SLAs, real impact (not just demos)  
✅ **Technical depth** – Complex problems that require architecture, optimization, scale  
✅ **Strong engineering culture** – Code quality matters, testing is standard, documentation exists  
✅ **Learning environment** – Access to new technologies, conferences, training budget  
✅ **Barcelona connection** – Office in Barcelona, or remote with quarterly visits

### **Nice-to-Haves:**
🌟 **Open source contributions** – Company contributes to or uses OSS heavily  
🌟 **Scale-up phase** – Growing fast, building platforms, high impact per engineer  
🌟 **Multi-cloud** – Azure + GCP, or willingness to support both  
🌟 **Domain expertise** – Fintech, healthcare, energy tech, cybersecurity  
🌟 **CTO track** – Clear path from IC → Tech Lead → Engineering Manager → CTO

### **Deal-Breakers:**
❌ **No production systems** – Pure research or consulting without deployment  
❌ **Non-technical management** – 100% management role with no hands-on coding  
❌ **Legacy tech** – On-prem only, no cloud, no Kubernetes, no modern AI stack  
❌ **Toxic culture** – Poor work-life balance, no code reviews, hero culture  
❌ **No Barcelona connection** – Fully remote with no possibility of in-person collaboration

## Communication Preferences

**First Contact:**
- Email is best for initial reach-out (include role description, company info, salary range if possible)
- LinkedIn messages also work (but email gets faster response)

**Interview Process:**
- **Phone/Video Screen (30 min):** Quick intro, role overview, mutual fit check
- **Technical Interview (60-90 min):** Architecture discussion, system design, code review
- **Team Interview (60 min):** Meet potential teammates, discuss collaboration style
- **Final Interview (45 min):** Meet hiring manager/CTO, discuss vision and growth path

**Timeline Expectation:**
- Ideal: 2-3 weeks from first contact to offer
- Maximum: 6 weeks (longer than that signals slow decision-making)

**Transparency I Appreciate:**
- Salary range upfront (saves everyone time)
- Clear role expectations (IC vs. leadership, % coding vs. meetings)
- Honest feedback after interviews (what went well, what didn't)

---

## Salary Expectations

**Location:** Barcelona (or remote with Barcelona connection)  
**Experience:** 2+ years in MLOps/GenAI, 8+ Azure certifications, production deployments

**Target Range:**
- **Senior MLOps Engineer:** €55k-€70k + equity/bonus
- **Staff MLOps Engineer / AI Platform Engineer:** €65k-€80k + equity/bonus
- **Technical Lead:** €70k-€85k + equity/bonus

**Note:** Willing to negotiate based on company stage, equity, learning opportunities, and team quality. Salary is important, but not the only factor.

---

## What Happens Next?

1. **You reach out** via email or LinkedIn with role details
2. **I respond** within 24-48 hours (usually faster)
3. **We schedule** a 30-minute intro call
4. **We decide** together if there's a mutual fit
5. **We move forward** with technical interviews or **we part ways** respectfully

**Either outcome is fine.** I'd rather have an honest "not a fit" conversation early than waste anyone's time.
