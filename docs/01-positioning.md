# Positioning & Problems I Solve

## Who I Am

**MLOps Engineer** with a platform engineering mindset, moving toward **AI Platform Engineer / Technical Lead** roles on a CTO track. I specialize in taking AI from prototype to production—focusing on **agentic systems**, **RAG architectures**, and **MLOps infrastructure** that actually works at scale.

**Current Context:**
- 2+ years hands-on MLOps/GenAI in enterprise environments (banking, energy, cybersecurity, industrial)
- Strong in **Azure** (Azure OpenAI, AKS, AI Search), learning **GCP** (Vertex AI, GKE)
- Infrastructure-first approach: Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, observability
- Based in **Barcelona**, open to remote work

## Problems I Solve

### 1. **"We have LLM demos but can't ship to production"**
**What I do:**
- Design production RAG architectures with hybrid search, reranking, and vector databases
- Implement evaluation frameworks (accuracy, latency, cost) with automated testing
- Set up governance: prompt versioning, model traceability, audit logs, compliance controls
- Optimize inference costs (prompt caching, model selection, batch processing)

**Experience:** Deployed 2 production RAG systems for banking clients with enterprise security and compliance

---

### 2. **"Our ML pipelines are fragile and manual"**
**What I do:**
- Build MLOps platforms with MLflow/Kubernetes for experiment tracking and model registry
- Design CI/CD pipelines for model training, validation, and deployment
- Implement monitoring: model drift detection, performance metrics, alerting
- Create reproducible workflows with Docker, Terraform, and infrastructure-as-code

**Experience:** Led MLOps methodology definition and infrastructure management for multiple clients

---

### 3. **"We need autonomous AI agents but don't know where to start"**
**What I do:**
- Architect multi-agent systems using LangGraph/LangChain with clear state management
- Design agent orchestration patterns: hierarchical, sequential, parallel workflows
- Implement observability: agent traces, decision logs, performance analytics
- Build governance frameworks: agent permissions, resource limits, failure handling

**Experience:** Built agent mesh platform with YAML-configurable workflows and centralized monitoring

---

### 4. **"GPU costs are eating our budget"**
**What I do:**
- Optimize model serving with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and TensorRT
- Implement batching strategies and model quantization for cost efficiency
- Design hybrid deployment: critical workloads on GPU, batch jobs on CPU
- Set up usage analytics and cost attribution per team/project

**Experience:** Led GPU-accelerated deepfake detection achieving 0.99 accuracy on benchmark datasets

- Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph, LangChain)
- Autonomous workflows with human-in-the-loop
- Agent evaluation and safety patterns
- State management and context handling

### **RAG & Vector Search**
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Vector database selection and optimization (Pinecone, Weaviate, Azure AI Search)
- Chunking strategies and embedding models
- Retrieval evaluation and reranking

### **MLOps Platform**
- Kubernetes-native ML serving
- Experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases)
- Model registry and versioning
- CI/CD for ML (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions)

### **Cloud & Infrastructure**
- Multi-cloud: Azure (strong), GCP (learning), AWS (familiar)
- Infrastructure-as-Code: Terraform, Helm, Kustomize
- Container orchestration: Kubernetes, Docker Compose
- GPU computing: CUDA, Triton, NVIDIA NIM

### **AI Governance**
- Evaluation frameworks and quality metrics
- Observability and monitoring (Application Insights, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Cost optimization and resource management
- Compliance and security (GDPR, OWASP, enterprise standards)

## What Makes Me Different

1. **Infrastructure Mindset** – I think in platforms, not one-off solutions. Everything is Kubernetes-native, IaC-managed, and observable.

2. **Production-First** – I've shipped real production systems with SLAs, not just demos. I understand cost, compliance, and operational trade-offs.

3. **Multi-Cloud Fluency** – Strong in Azure, actively learning GCP, comfortable with AWS. I can design portable architectures.

4. **Platform → CTO Track** – I'm not just building models; I'm building systems that enable teams. Leadership and strategy are equally important to me.

5. **Rapid Learner** – 11 certifications in 2 years. I adapt quickly to new stacks and can ramp up on unfamiliar technologies fast.
