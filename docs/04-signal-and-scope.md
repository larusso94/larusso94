## What I Do (End-to-End AI Systems)

### **I build production AI systems from architecture to deployment**

**What this means:**
- I start with the problem (not the tech stack) and design the solution
- I write code (Python, Terraform, YAML) and deploy it to Kubernetes
- I set up monitoring, cost tracking, and alerting
- I hand off documentation, runbooks, and training to teams

**Example workflow:**
1. **Discovery:** Understand business problem, constraints (cost, latency, compliance)
2. **Architecture:** Design system (RAG, agents, MLOps platform) with trade-off analysis
3. **Implementation:** Build pipelines, APIs, infrastructure-as-code
4. **Deployment:** Ship to Kubernetes with CI/CD, monitoring, rollback plans
5. **Iteration:** Monitor metrics, gather feedback, improve over time

**What I don't do:**
- I don't just write specs and hand off to other engineers
- I don't build one-off prototypes without production path
- I don't disappear after deployment (I care about operational success)

---

## What I Don't Do (Clear Boundaries)

### **1. Pure Data Science / Research**
**I don't:** Train models from scratch, publish papers, do novel ML research  
**But I can:** Integrate pre-trained models, fine-tune embeddings, optimize inference

**Why:** My strength is taking AI from prototype to production. If you need someone to invent a new algorithm, I'm not your person. If you need someone to deploy an existing model reliably at scale, I am.

---

### **2. Frontend Development**
**I don't:** Build React apps, design UIs, write extensive frontend code  
**But I can:** Build simple dashboards (Gradio, Streamlit), integrate with frontend teams via REST APIs, design API contracts

**Why:** I focus on backend systems and infrastructure. I can prototype UIs for demos, but production frontends should be handled by frontend specialists.

---

### **3. Traditional IT / Non-AI Infrastructure**
**I don't:** Manage Windows servers, set up Active Directory, configure VPNs  
**But I can:** Work with IT teams to integrate AI systems, understand networking basics, design secure cloud architectures

**Why:** I'm an AI infrastructure engineer, not a general IT admin. I know Kubernetes, Terraform, cloud services—but my focus is AI workloads.

---

### **4. Non-Technical Roles**
**I don't:** Product management (roadmaps, prioritization), pure sales, non-technical leadership  
**But I can:** Lead technical teams, influence product decisions with technical insights, present to clients/stakeholders

**Why:** I'm happiest when I'm building systems, not just managing people or doing sales. I want to be a "player-coach" (hands-on technical lead), not a pure manager.

## Trade-Offs I Optimize For

### **1. Cloud Expertise: Azure > GCP > AWS**

**Current state:**
- **Azure:** Strong (2+ years, production deployments, 8 certifications)
- **GCP:** Learning (Vertex AI, GKE, basic deployments)
- **AWS:** Familiar (concepts, some services, but limited production experience)

**Trade-off:**
- If you need Azure, I'm ready day 1
- If you need GCP, I can ramp up in 2-4 weeks (actively learning)
- If you need AWS, I can learn it, but it will take 1-2 months to be productive

**Why:** I specialized in Azure because Deloitte clients were Azure-heavy. I'm expanding to GCP because it's strong in ML (Vertex AI, TPUs). AWS is next on my list.

---

### **2. AI Workloads: Agentic AI > RAG > Traditional ML**

**Current state:**
- **Agentic AI:** Strong (LangGraph, multi-agent systems, production deployments)
- **RAG:** Strong (hybrid search, reranking, evaluation frameworks)
- **Traditional ML:** Familiar (scikit-learn, XGBoost, basic model training)

**Trade-off:**
- If you need agentic systems or RAG, I'm your expert
- If you need traditional ML (regression, classification), I can do it, but others may be faster

**Why:** I focus on GenAI and LLM-based systems because that's where the market is moving. I can handle traditional ML, but my differentiation is in modern AI architectures.

---

### **3. Infrastructure: Kubernetes-Native**

**Current state:**
- **Kubernetes:** Strong (AKS, GKE, Helm, Terraform, production deployments)
- **Serverless:** Familiar (Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, basic use cases)
- **VMs:** Familiar (can use them, but prefer Kubernetes)

**Trade-off:**
- If you want cloud-native, containerized systems, I'm ideal
- If you want serverless-first, I can adapt, but Kubernetes is my default

**Why:** Kubernetes is the industry standard for scalable, portable systems. I design everything to run in K8s because it's reproducible and multi-cloud.

---

### **4. Programming: Python-First**

**Current state:**
- **Python:** Strong (production code, FastAPI, LangChain, Terraform, CI/CD)
- **Bash/Shell:** Familiar (scripting, automation)
- **Other languages:** Can read Go, JavaScript, but not production-ready

**Trade-off:**
- If your stack is Python-based, I'm productive immediately
- If your stack is Go/Rust/Java, I'll need time to learn (1-2 months)

**Why:** Python is the language of AI/ML. I focus on mastering one language deeply rather than being mediocre at many.

---

### **5. Team Size: Small-to-Medium (Startup/Scale-up)**

**Current state:**
- **Enterprise:** Experienced (Deloitte, large clients, compliance, governance)
- **Scale-up:** Ideal (50-500 people, building platforms, high impact)
- **Startup:** Interested (early-stage, moving fast, wearing many hats)

**Trade-off:**
- If you're a scale-up building AI platforms, I'm a great fit
- If you're a 10,000-person enterprise, I can navigate it, but prefer smaller/faster
- If you're a 5-person startup, I can thrive, but expect me to do everything (no specialization)

**Why:** I want high impact and fast iteration. Scale-ups offer the best balance: resources to build properly, speed to ship quickly.

## What I'm Learning (Expansion Areas)

1. **GCP / Vertex AI** – Deepening multi-cloud expertise
2. **Advanced Agentic Patterns** – CrewAI, Autogen, custom orchestration
3. **Cost Optimization** – Token caching, model quantization, batch processing
4. **Governance Frameworks** – AI compliance, evaluation standards, safety patterns
5. **Leadership Skills** – Technical team lead → Engineering Manager → CTO track

---

## How This Shapes My Ideal Role

**Best fit:**
- **Senior/Staff MLOps Engineer** or **AI Platform Engineer**
- Building production AI systems (RAG, agents, MLOps platforms)
- Azure or GCP environment (prefer Azure, learning GCP)
- Scale-up or growth-stage company (50-500 people)
- Barcelona-based or remote with Barcelona visits
- Team that values end-to-end ownership and production quality

**Not a fit:**
- Pure research roles (academia, ML theory)
- Frontend-heavy roles (React, UI design)
- Non-AI infrastructure roles (traditional IT, networking)
- 100% management roles (no hands-on coding)
- AWS-only environments (unless training is provided)
