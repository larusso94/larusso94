# Case Studies

> **Work in Progress:** This section will contain detailed documentation of end-to-end production AI projects. Each case study will be traceable to a public GitHub repository with full implementation details.

## 🚧 Coming Soon

I'm currently developing comprehensive case studies that demonstrate production AI systems from architecture to deployment. Each case study will include:

- **Full GitHub Repository** with working code
- **Architecture Documentation** with diagrams and decision records
- **Implementation Details** including challenges and solutions
- **Deployment Pipeline** with CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code
- **Evaluation Metrics** and performance benchmarks

### Planned Case Studies

**1. Production RAG System (In Progress)**
- End-to-end RAG implementation with evaluation framework
- Hybrid search, LLM integration, cost optimization
- Full documentation of architecture decisions
- [Repository: TBD]

**2. MLOps Platform Starter**
- Kubernetes-native ML platform with experiment tracking
- Model registry, CI/CD, monitoring
- Terraform modules for multi-cloud deployment
- [Repository: TBD]

**3. Agentic Workflow System**
- Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph
- YAML-based configuration, observability
- Cost attribution and governance
- [Repository: TBD]

## Why Public Case Studies?

While I have extensive consulting experience, I'm building public, verifiable demonstrations of:
- **Production-quality code** (not just demos)
- **Real architectural decisions** (with trade-offs documented)
- **End-to-end thinking** (from requirements to monitoring)
- **Operational patterns** (CI/CD, observability, security)
