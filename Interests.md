## Interests & Motivators

### Core Motivators
- Impact at scale: Building platforms, architectures, and systems that enable multiple use cases and teams
- Technical excellence: High standards for production quality, observability, security, and operational robustness
- Mastery and autonomy: Ownership of technical decisions, control over tooling and environment, agency in execution
- Cutting-edge innovation: Working with state-of-the-art technologies (GenAI, RAG, NVIDIA stack, agent systems)
- Knowledge transfer: Training teams, creating documentation, enabling consultants and stakeholders
- Problem complexity: Dense technical challenges requiring systemic thinking and multi-layer solutions
- Client impact: Delivering measurable value to enterprise clients across banking, energy, cybersecurity sectors

### Optimal Work Environment
- Technical leadership or senior IC role with architectural influence
- Platform engineering, MLOps infrastructure, or AI CoE positions
- Consulting or solution architecture with direct client engagement
- Hybrid technical-strategic roles bridging engineering and business
- Small to medium teams (5-15) with high technical competence
- Collaborative but autonomous: clear interfaces, ownership boundaries, minimal micromanagement
- Learning-oriented culture: space for experimentation, R&D time, conference/certification support
- Direct communication: low politics, high transparency, evidence-based decision making
- Scale-ups or mature enterprises with strong engineering culture
- Cloud-native, AI-first companies or advanced digital transformation units within enterprises
- Industries: Fintech, energy tech, healthcare AI, cybersecurity, industrial automation
- Work mode: Hybrid or remote-first with occasional in-person for high-bandwidth collaboration

### Personality Frameworks
- **Big Five Estimate:**
	- Openness: High — Explores diverse technologies, embraces complexity, seeks novel solutions
	- Conscientiousness: Medium-High — Strong quality standards, structured approach, but can be challenged by saturation
	- Extraversion: Medium — Energized by technical leadership and client engagement, needs autonomy for deep work
	- Agreeableness: Medium — Ethical and collaborative, but direct communication style, not complacent
	- Neuroticism: Low-Medium — Stable under pressure, but sensitive to operational friction (blocked access, tools failures)
- **Working Genius:**
	- Primary: Wonder (ideation/vision), Invention (solution design), Discernment (evaluation/critique)
	- Competencies: Enablement (training/support), Tenacity (completion under constraints)
	- Frustrations: Galvanizing (rallying people), Pure execution without design input
